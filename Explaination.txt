## EXPLAINATION: 


==> What You Want to Set Up
1. Special Hosting Plan for Customers
A new customer (like Joe) signs up for hosting.

He pays a one-time setup fee (example: $25).

Hosting is free for the first year.

After 365 days, Joe starts paying $20/month for hosting automatically.

You want this to be fully automated.

2. Special Affiliate Program
Joe joins your Affiliate Program and gets his custom link.

He shares this link on his website, YouTube, Instagram, etc.

Someone (Nick) clicks on Joe’s link and signs up for hosting:

Nick pays $25 setup fee.

Hosting is free for one year.

After 1 year, he pays $20/month automatically.

How Joe Gets Paid as an Affiliate:
When Nick signs up, Joe gets $10 once (one-time bonus).

If Nick stays for 1 year and starts paying monthly, then:

Joe gets $1 every month as long as Nick keeps paying.

==> What Needs to Be Built
 = A custom product setup:

$25 setup fee

Free 1st year

$20/month auto-bill after 1 year

 = Custom affiliate system on top of WHMCS:

Tracks referrals and time

Pays $10 once

After 1 year, pays $1/month if the customer keeps paying

 = Editable settings in Admin Panel:

Change setup fee, monthly charge, payout amounts, and time periods easily.

==> What This Involves Technically
WHMCS product configuration with custom billing logic

WHMCS affiliate hook customization

 = A new addon module or hook to:

Track signups

Wait 365 days

Check if customer is still active

Pay monthly reward to referrer

A settings page in WHMCS admin to change payout values and timeframes

==> Estimated Price & Time
Here’s a rough estimate (assuming clean WHMCS setup and no unusual complications):

Feature	Estimate
Setup fee + delayed billing setup	₹5,000 – ₹8,000
Custom affiliate logic (one-time + recurring after 1 year)	₹10,000 – ₹15,000
Admin settings panel (editable time & money values)	₹5,000 – ₹8,000
Total Estimate	₹20,000 – ₹30,000
Time Required	6 – 8 working days

==> Summary
 = You want:

A hosting product: ₹25 now, ₹20/month after 1 year.

A special affiliate system: ₹10 when someone signs up, ₹1/month after 1 year.

Admin control to change these amounts and timing.

If this is approved, more features or customizations can be added later.
